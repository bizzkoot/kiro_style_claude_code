# Kiro Implementer Command - Enhanced with Dynamic Subagent Integration

## Overview
Enhanced implementer combines Kiro TAD's specification-driven rigor with dynamic subagent discovery and EARS-compliant delegation through 3-phase execution.

**Enhanced Capabilities:**
- **Dynamic Discovery**: Auto-discovers available subagents from `.claude/agents/` manifest
- **EARS Delegation**: Preserves behavioral contracts during task routing
- **3-Phase Execution**: Discovery → Planning → Implementation with autonomous decision-making
- **Performance Optimized**: Sub-200ms agent discovery through manifest caching

## Command Usage
```
/kiro-implementer [feature-name] [options]
/kiro-implementer resume [feature-name] [phase]
```

**Options:**
- `start` - Begin new implementation from Phase 1
- `resume` - Continue existing implementation
- `without-approval` - Skip user approval for experienced teams

## 3-Phase Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Dynamic Discovery
**EARS Context**: WHEN Phase 1 Discovery starts, SHALL scan .claude/agents/ directory and create internal "Capabilities Briefing"

**Auto-Discovery Process:**
1. **Environment Survey**: Scans `.claude/agents/` for available subagents
2. **Capability Mapping**: Extracts purpose/specialization from manifest
3. **Performance Loading**: Uses cached manifest for sub-200ms discovery
4. **Strategic Assessment**: Analyzes requirements against available capabilities

**Discovery Output**: Internal capabilities briefing with subagent purposes and specializations.

### Phase 2: Strategic Planning
**EARS Context**: WHEN Phase 2 Planning executes, SHALL decompose EARS DoD requirements and map appropriate subagents with delegation rationale

**Planning Intelligence:**
1. **Requirement Decomposition**: Breaks EARS Definition of Done into discrete tasks
2. **Agent Mapping**: Matches task complexity/type to suitable specialist agents
3. **Delegation Strategy**: Plans which tasks to delegate vs handle directly
4. **Context Optimization**: Prepares minimal necessary EARS context for each delegation

**Planning Output**: Detailed delegation roadmap with rationale for each assignment.

### Phase 3: EARS-Compliant Implementation
**EARS Context**: WHILE Phase 3 Implementation runs, SHALL invoke subagents with @<subagent-name> format providing EARS context and acceptance criteria

**Implementation Execution:**
1. **Smart Delegation**: Invokes appropriate subagents with `@<subagent-name>` format
2. **Context Injection**: Provides specific EARS acceptance criteria and minimal context
3. **Output Validation**: Validates subagent outputs against original behavioral contracts
4. **Fallback Handling**: Retries with enhanced context or falls back to direct implementation

## Dynamic Subagent Discovery

### Manifest-Based Discovery
**Performance**: Sub-200ms discovery for 100+ agents through intelligent manifest caching
**Architecture**: JSON manifest with lazy-loaded capabilities briefing

### Currently Available Subagents
*Auto-discovered from `.claude/agents/subagents-manifest.json`:*

```javascript
// Phase 1: Discovery Engine (Optimized)
const discoveryEngine = {
    async scanAgents() {
        const manifestPath = './.claude/agents/subagents-manifest.json';
        try {
            const manifest = await this.loadManifest(manifestPath);
            return this.generateCapabilitiesBriefing(manifest.agents);
        } catch (error) {
            return this.fallbackFileSystemScan();
        }
    },
    
    generateCapabilitiesBriefing(agents) {
        const grouped = this.groupBySpecialization(agents);
        return Object.entries(grouped).map(([spec, agentList]) => 
            `**${spec}**: ${agentList.map(a => `@${a.name}`).join(', ')}`
        ).join('\n');
    }
};
```

**Discovery Metrics** (Current Installation):
- Total Available: 288 specialized agents
- Performance: Sub-200ms manifest loading (cached)
- Specializations: 27 categories (Security, Testing, Performance, etc.)

## EARS-Compliant Delegation Protocol

### Context Injection Pattern
When delegating to subagents:
```
EARS Context Package:
- Requirement ID: REQ-{UUID}-XXX
- Acceptance Criteria: Specific EARS statements (WHEN/WHILE/IF/WHERE + SHALL)
- Behavioral Contracts: Expected component behavior specifications
- Minimal Context: Feature summary, constraints, dependencies only
```

### Validation Pipeline
1. **Pre-Delegation**: Validate EARS context completeness
2. **Post-Output**: Check outputs against original behavioral contracts
3. **Retry Logic**: Enhanced context or fallback if validation fails
4. **Integration**: Validate final integration against all EARS criteria

### Example Delegation
```
@code-reviewer: Review implementation against EARS acceptance criteria:

AC-FEAT-123-001: WHEN user submits form, system SHALL validate within 200ms
AC-FEAT-123-002: IF validation fails, system SHALL display specific error messages

[Minimal implementation context provided]

Expected: Review feedback with specific EARS compliance assessment
```

## Pre-Tasks Q&A (Implementation Clarification)
Before generating tasks.md, conduct targeted implementation clarification:

**Scope Clarification (EARS-Driven):**
- Parse EARS acceptance criteria and NFRs from requirements.md and design.md
- Clarify MVP vs full feature scope based on EARS priority levels
- Identify resource constraints and team capacity for EARS compliance
- Ask max 2-3 questions about implementation priorities, EARS validation approach, deployment approach

**Implementation Context (EARS-Aware):**
- Development team size and expertise levels with BDD/EARS experience
- Testing strategy preferences (unit/integration/e2e) with EARS-to-BDD translation capabilities
- Risk tolerance for complex vs simple implementation approaches
- EARS compliance validation tools and frameworks available

## CLAUDE.md Context Validation (Pre-Implementation)
Before generating tasks.md, validate if current project context supports implementation:

**Context Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Technology stack in CLAUDE.md matches design.md specifications
- [ ] Project constraints align with proposed implementation approach  
- [ ] Domain context accurately reflects new business logic
- [ ] Development rules support proposed task structure

**If context misalignment detected:**
Recommend updating CLAUDE.md sections with specific updates needed before proceeding.

## tasks.md (Execution Blueprint)
```markdown
# Tasks: [Feature Name] - Enhanced Implementer Agent
## Context Summary
Feature UUID: FEAT-{UUID} | Architecture: [Key patterns] | Risk: {Overall score}

## Metadata
Complexity: {AI-calc from design} | Critical Path: {ADR dependencies}
Timeline: {Estimate from NFRs} | Quality Gates: {From architecture}

## Progress: 0/X Complete, 0 In Progress, 0 Not Started, 0 Blocked

## Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] TASK-{UUID}-001: [Component Setup]
  Trace: REQ-{UUID}-001 | Design: NewComponent | AC: AC-{REQ-ID}-01
  ADR: ADR-001 | Approach: [Specific implementation method]
  DoD (EARS Format): WHEN component initialized, SHALL satisfy AC-{REQ-ID}-01 with 100% test coverage
  Risk: Low | Effort: 2pts | Delegation: @component-architect
  Test Strategy: [EARS-to-BDD unit tests] | Dependencies: None

## Phase 2: Integration  
- [ ] TASK-{UUID}-002: [API Implementation]
  Trace: REQ-{UUID}-002 | Design: POST /api/x | AC: AC-{REQ-ID}-02
  DoD (EARS Format): WHEN endpoint deployed, SHALL handle requests per EARS contract
  Risk: Low | Effort: 3pts | Delegation: @api-designer
  Dependencies: TASK-001

## Phase 3: Quality Assurance
- [ ] TASK-{UUID}-003: [Comprehensive Testing]
  Trace: ALL AC-* + NFR-* | Design: Test architecture
  DoD (EARS Format): WHEN tests execute, SHALL validate every EARS acceptance criterion
  Risk: Medium | Effort: 4pts | Delegation: @test-automator
  Dependencies: All previous

## Verification Checklist (EARS Compliance)
- [ ] Every REQ-* → implementing task with EARS DoD
- [ ] Every EARS AC → BDD test coverage (Given/When/Then)
- [ ] Every EARS NFR → measurable validation with specific triggers
- [ ] All design EARS contracts → implementation tasks with subagent delegation
```

## Implementation Commands

### Standard Workflow
```bash
# 1. Initialize enhanced capabilities (if not done)
./enhance-kiro-subagents.sh

# 2. Start implementation with 3-phase execution
/kiro-implementer [feature-name] start

# 3. Resume from specific phase if needed
/kiro-implementer resume [feature-name] "Phase 2"
```

### Quality Assurance Integration
All implementations maintain:
- ✅ **Requirement Traceability**: Every task maps to specific EARS acceptance criteria
- ✅ **Behavioral Contract Compliance**: All outputs validated against original specifications
- ✅ **Delegation Transparency**: Clear rationale for each specialist assignment with @subagent format
- ✅ **Performance Standards**: Sub-3-second discovery, automated validation pipelines

## Advanced Features

### Intelligent Fallback
If subagent delegation fails or produces non-compliant output:
1. **Enhanced Context Retry**: Provide additional context and retry once
2. **Direct Implementation**: Fall back to standard kiro-implementer execution
3. **Escalation Path**: Clear guidance for manual intervention if needed

### Performance Monitoring
- Discovery phase timing and agent count reporting
- Delegation success rates and fallback frequency
- EARS compliance validation metrics
- Context optimization effectiveness

## User Approval Gate
After generating tasks.md, explicitly request user approval:
- Present tasks.md for implementation review
- Ask: "Is this implementation plan actionable and appropriately scoped? Any task adjustments needed?"
- Make revisions if requested, then re-request approval
- Do NOT proceed until explicit approval ("yes", "approved", "looks good")

## Execution Rules
- ALWAYS read requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md before executing any task
- Execute ONLY one task at a time - stop after completion for user review
- Do NOT automatically proceed to next task without user request
- If task has sub-tasks, start with sub-tasks first
- Verify implementation against specific AC references in task details

**Task Updates**: Change [ ] to [x], update progress count
**Smart Completion** (100%): Auto-validate vs requirements+design, archive to specs/done/

## Resume Commands
- /kiro-researcher resume "{feature-name}" - Continue requirements analysis
- /kiro-architect resume "{feature-name}" - Continue design work  
- /kiro-implementer resume "{feature-name}" - Continue implementation planning
