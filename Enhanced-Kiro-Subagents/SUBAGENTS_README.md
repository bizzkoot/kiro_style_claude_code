## üéØ How It Works: 3.5-Phase Execution & Core Features

This installation transforms your `/kiro-implementer` with a powerful 3.5-phase workflow and new capabilities, all designed for performance, traceability, and efficiency.

### The 3.5-Phase Process

The enhanced implementer follows a structured process for robust, traceable, and optimized development.

</div>

*   **Phase 1: Discovery**: Scans the `subagents-manifest.json` to identify all available subagents and their specializations (<200ms). This result is saved to a state file for quick resume.
*   **Phase 2: Planning**: Analyzes EARS requirements, performs an optimization assessment, estimates token budgets, and assigns the best agent for each job in `tasks.md`.
*   **Phase 2.5: Optimization Review (New)**: Validates that the proposed plan is not over-engineered and represents a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) approach. Requires user approval before proceeding.
*   **Phase 3: Implementation**: Executes tasks sequentially, delegating to the assigned subagents with full EARS and optimization context to ensure compliance and efficiency.

### Core Features

*   **295+ Specialized Subagents**: Access to the entire @davepoon subagent collection for any task.
*   **Built-in Optimization**: Includes rules and processes to prevent over-engineering, prioritize MVP solutions, and manage complexity with token budgets.
*   **EARS-Compliant Delegation**: Injects requirement traceability into every subagent action.
*   **Stateful Resume**: Seamlessly stop and continue your work. The system loads state from `.claude/state/implementer-state/[feature-name].json` to preserve context and agent assignments, skipping the discovery phase on resume.
*   **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Progress indicators, automatic configuration backups, and comprehensive error handling.

## üéÆ Usage & Command Workflow

The enhanced implementer introduces commands for managing the implementation lifecycle.

### Command Workflow

```bash
# 1. Start a new feature (discovers agents, creates tasks.md)
/kiro-implementer user-authentication start

# Work on a few tasks, then stop for the day...

# 2. Resume your work (loads state, continues from where you left off)
/kiro-implementer resume user-authentication

# 3. Continue to the next task after one is complete
/kiro-implementer user-authentication continue
```

### Generated `tasks.md` Example

The system analyzes your `requirements.md` and `design.md` to generate a `tasks.md` file like this:

```markdown
# Tasks: User Authentication - Enhanced Implementer

## Progress: 2/4 Complete, 1 In Progress, 1 Not Started

## Phase 1: Foundation Tasks
- [x] **TASK-001: Authentication Schema Design**
  - **Requirement**: REQ-AUTH-001 - User credential validation
  - **EARS AC**: WHEN user submits login, SHALL validate within 200ms
  - **Assigned**: @database-expert
  - **Complexity**: Simple (use existing user table + password hash)
  - **Token Budget**: ~200 tokens
  - **Dependencies**: None

## Phase 2: Implementation Tasks  
- [x] **TASK-002: API Endpoint Implementation**
  - **Requirement**: REQ-AUTH-002 - Login/logout endpoints
  - **EARS AC**: WHEN endpoint called, SHALL return JWT token
  - **Assigned**: @api-designer
  - **Complexity**: Simple
  - **Token Budget**: ~300 tokens
  - **Dependencies**: TASK-001

## üîß Installation Details

### What Gets Installed

Running `./enhance-kiro-subagents.sh` performs the following:

*   **Subagent Collection**: Downloads 295+ specialized `.md` subagent files to `~/.claude/agents/` or `./.claude/agents/`.
*   **Optimized Manifest**: Creates `subagents-manifest.json` for fast discovery.
*   **Enhanced Kiro Implementer**: Replaces the standard implementer with the enhanced 3.5-phase version.
*   **Support Files**: Installs required protocols and templates for delegation and discovery.
*   **Safety Backups**: Automatically backs up your existing `kiro-implementer.md` to your Desktop.

### Global vs Project Installation

*   **Global (`~/.claude/agents/`)**: Recommended for individual developers. Agents are available to all projects.
*   **Project (`./.claude/agents/`)**: Recommended for teams. Agents are isolated to the current project and can be version-controlled.

---

## üîç Verification & Troubleshooting

### Confirm Installation Success

1.  **Check Agents**: `ls ~/.claude/agents/ | wc -l` (should show 295+ files).
2.  **Verify Manifest**: `cat ~/.claude/agents/subagents-manifest.json | head -5`.
3.  **Test Implementer**: `/kiro-implementer --help` (should show 3.5-phase execution strategy).

### Common Issues

*   **"Permission denied"**: Make the script executable with `chmod +x enhance-kiro-subagents.sh`.
*   **"Git not found"**: Install git (`brew install git` or `apt-get install git`).
*   **"Network connection failed"**: Check your internet connection and firewall settings.
*   **Recovery**: Your original `kiro-implementer.md` is backed up to your Desktop if you need to restore it.
