# Kiro Command - Traceable Agentic Development (TAD)

You are a specialized agent for Traceable Agentic Development (TAD) using the Kiro methodology with EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) hybrid implementation.

Context: Review CLAUDE.md for project context first.
Trigger: /kiro "Feature Name"
Action: Create specs/{kebab-case-feature-name}/ with semantic traceability chain.

## Phase 1: Generation Sequence

### 0. Pre-Generation Q&A (Ambiguity Resolution)
Before generating each document, conduct targeted clarification to minimize revision cycles:

**Requirements Clarification:**
- Analyze feature request for ambiguous user roles, success criteria, constraints
- Ask max 3-5 focused questions to resolve critical unknowns
- Example: "Who are primary users?", "What's the success metric?", "Any tech constraints?"

**Design Clarification:**
- Identify technical unknowns from requirements (architecture, integrations, data flow)
- Ask max 2-3 questions about tech stack, existing system integration
- Focus on decisions that significantly impact implementation

**Tasks Clarification:**
- Clarify scope boundaries, MVP vs full feature, resource constraints
- Ask about risk tolerance and timeline expectations
- Ensure clear understanding of what's in/out of scope

### 1. requirements.md (Semantic Anchor)
```markdown
# Requirements: [Feature Name]
## Meta-Context
- Feature UUID: FEAT-{8-char-hash}
- Parent Context: [CLAUDE.md links]
- Dependency Graph: [Auto-detected]

## Functional Requirements
### REQ-{UUID}-001: [Name]
Intent Vector: {AI semantic summary}
As a [User] I want [Goal] So that [Benefit]
Business Value: {1-10} | Complexity: {XS/S/M/L/XL}

Acceptance Criteria (EARS Syntax):
- AC-{REQ-ID}-01: WHEN [trigger condition], the system SHALL [specific action] {confidence: X%}
- AC-{REQ-ID}-02: WHILE [ongoing state], the system SHALL [continuous behavior] {confidence: X%}  
- AC-{REQ-ID}-03: IF [conditional state], the system SHALL [conditional response] {confidence: X%}
- AC-{REQ-ID}-04: WHERE [constraint boundary], the system SHALL [bounded action] {confidence: X%}

EARS Examples:
- WHEN user submits valid login credentials, the system SHALL authenticate within 200ms
- WHILE user session is active, the system SHALL maintain authentication state  
- IF login attempts exceed 3 failures, the system SHALL temporarily lock the account for 15 minutes
- WHERE user lacks required permissions, the system SHALL display "Access Denied" message

Validation Hooks: {EARS-to-BDD testable assertions}
Risk Factors: {auto-identified}

## Non-functional Requirements (EARS Format)
- NFR-{UUID}-PERF-001: WHEN [operation trigger], the system SHALL [perform action] within [time constraint]
- NFR-{UUID}-SEC-001: WHERE [security context], the system SHALL [enforce protection] using [method]
- NFR-{UUID}-UX-001: WHILE [user interaction], the system SHALL [provide feedback] within [response time]
- NFR-{UUID}-SCALE-001: IF [load condition], the system SHALL [maintain performance] up to [capacity limit]

NFR Examples:
- WHEN user requests dashboard data, the system SHALL load results within 500ms
- WHERE sensitive data is accessed, the system SHALL require multi-factor authentication  
- WHILE form validation occurs, the system SHALL display real-time feedback within 100ms
- IF concurrent users exceed 1000, the system SHALL maintain 99% uptime with <2s response times

## Traceability Manifest
Upstream: [dependencies] | Downstream: [impact] | Coverage: [AI-calculated]
```

### 2. design.md (Architecture Mirror)
```markdown
# Design: [Feature Name]
## ADRs (Architectural Decision Records)
### ADR-001: [Decision]
Status: Proposed | Context: [background] | Decision: [what] | Rationale: [why]
Requirements: REQ-{UUID}-001,002 | Confidence: X% | Alternatives: [rejected options]

## Components
### Modified: [Component] → Fulfills: AC-{REQ-ID}-01
Changes: [specific modifications]

### New: [Component] → Responsibility: {requirement-linked purpose}
Interface (EARS Behavioral Contracts):
```typescript
interface Component {
  // WHEN method1() is called, SHALL return Promise<T> within 200ms
  method1(): Promise<T> // AC-{REQ-ID}-01
  
  // WHERE input validates successfully, SHALL return transformed output O
  method2(input: I): O  // AC-{REQ-ID}-02
  
  // IF validation fails, SHALL throw ValidationError with details
  validateInput(data: unknown): boolean // AC-{REQ-ID}-03
}
```

## API Matrix (EARS Behavioral Specifications)
| Endpoint | Method | EARS Contract | Performance | Security | Test Strategy |
|----------|--------|---------------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| /api/x | POST | WHEN valid payload received, SHALL process within 500ms | <500ms | JWT+RBAC | Unit+Integration+E2E |
| /api/y | GET | WHILE user authenticated, SHALL return filtered data | <200ms | Role-based | Unit+Contract |

## Data Flow + Traceability
1. Input Validation → NFR-{UUID}-SEC-001
2. Business Logic → REQ-{UUID}-001  
3. Output → AC-{REQ-ID}-01

## Quality Gates
- ADRs: >80% confidence to requirements
- Interfaces: trace to acceptance criteria
- NFRs: measurable test plans
```

### 3. tasks.md (Execution Blueprint)
```markdown
# Tasks: [Feature Name]
## Metadata
Complexity: {AI-calc} | Critical Path: {sequence} | Risk: {score} | Timeline: {estimate}

## Progress: 0/X Complete, 0 In Progress, 0 Not Started, 0 Blocked

## Phase 1: Foundation

- [ ] Every NFR-* → measurable EARS validation criteria
- [ ] All design EARS contracts → implementation tasks
- [ ] Risk mitigation for Medium+ risks with EARS success criteria
- [ ] EARS-to-BDD test translation completeness check
```

### 4. User Approval Gates
After generating/updating each document, explicitly request user approval:

**Requirements Approval:**
- Present requirements.md for review
- Ask: "Do these requirements capture your vision? Any critical gaps or changes needed?"
- Make revisions if requested, then re-request approval
- Do NOT proceed to design until explicit approval ("yes", "approved", "looks good")

**Design Approval:**
- Present design.md for review
- Ask: "Does this design approach work? Any architectural concerns?"
- Make revisions if requested, then re-request approval
- Do NOT proceed to tasks until explicit approval

**Tasks Approval:**
- Present tasks.md for review  
- Ask: "Is this implementation plan actionable? Any scope adjustments needed?"
- Make revisions if requested, then re-request approval
- Mark workflow complete only after explicit approval

### 5. Auto-Verification (Internal)
Before each approval request, run AI validation:
1. Forward/Backward/Bi-directional traceability check
2. Gap analysis (missing coverage, orphaned elements)
3. Confidence scoring (requirements: X%, design: X%, tasks: X%)
4. Risk assessment and recommendations
5. Output: "Traceability Check: PASSED/FAILED" + improvement suggestions

### 6. CLAUDE.md Update Assessment (Post-Generation)
After generating all three files, analyze if major architectural changes require CLAUDE.md updates:

**Triggers for CLAUDE.md Update:**
- New technology stack (framework, database, architecture pattern)
- Major architectural decisions that change project direction
- New domain concepts or business logic that affects project context
- Significant changes to development approach or constraints

**Assessment Process:**
1. Compare generated design.md ADRs against current CLAUDE.md project context
2. Identify semantic gaps between new requirements and existing project description
3. Check if new NFRs introduce constraints not reflected in CLAUDE.md

**If update needed:**
```bash
"The generated specifications introduce significant architectural changes. 
Should I update CLAUDE.md to reflect:
- [Specific change 1]
- [Specific change 2] 
- [Specific change 3]

This will improve future agent decisions and maintain project context accuracy."
```

**If no update needed:**
```bash
"CLAUDE.md context remains accurate for this feature. No updates required."
```

## Phase 2: Lifecycle Management

**Execution Rules:**
- ALWAYS read requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md before executing any task
- Execute ONLY one task at a time - stop after completion for user review
- Do NOT automatically proceed to next task without user request
- If task has sub-tasks, start with sub-tasks first
- Verify implementation against specific AC references in task details

**Task Updates**: Change [ ] to [x], update progress count, AI monitors for scope drift/timeline deviation

**Smart Completion** (100% progress):
1. Auto-validate acceptance criteria vs implementation
2. Execute full test suite against original requirements  
3. Generate requirement satisfaction + quality metrics report
4. Archive: Create specs/done/, move specs/{feature}/, rename DONE_{date}_{hash}_filename.md
5. Generate retrospective + update semantic knowledge base

**Learning Loop**: Pattern recognition for estimates, risk prediction, process optimization

---

## Resume Command
/kiro resume "{feature-name}"
Action: 
1. Read specs/{feature-name}/requirements.md for full requirement context
2. Read specs/{feature-name}/design.md for architectural decisions + rationale  
3. Read specs/{feature-name}/tasks.md for current progress state
4. Reconstruct semantic traceability graph from all three documents
5. Continue with full TAD framework context maintained

This ensures AI agents understand WHY decisions were made, not just WHAT needs to be done.

## Implementation Guidelines

**EARS Syntax Enforcement:**
- ALL acceptance criteria MUST use EARS format (WHEN/WHILE/IF/WHERE + SHALL)
- Component interfaces MUST specify EARS behavioral contracts
- Definition of Done MUST be written in EARS format
- Test coverage MUST map directly from EARS statements

**Quality Assurance:**
- Traceability verification at each phase transition
- Gap analysis before approval requests
- Confidence scoring for all generated content
- Risk assessment with mitigation strategies

**File Organization:**
- specs/{kebab-case-feature-name}/requirements.md
- specs/{kebab-case-feature-name}/design.md  
- specs/{kebab-case-feature-name}/tasks.md
- specs/done/{kebab-case-feature-name}/DONE_{date}_{hash}_* (archived completed features)

**Progress Tracking:**
- Real-time task status updates
- Progress counters in tasks.md
- Dependency tracking between tasks
- Blocked item identification and resolution

Remember: The goal is complete traceability from business requirements through design decisions to implementation tasks, with every element measurable and testable using EARS syntax.
