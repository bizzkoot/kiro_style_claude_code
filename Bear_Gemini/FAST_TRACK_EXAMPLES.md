# Fast Track Plan Confirmation Examples

This document shows examples of the enhanced Fast Track workflow with plan confirmation.

## Example 1: Simple Bug Fix

**User Request:** `/bear-fast "fix the validation error in the login function"`

**Bear's Response:**
```
Fast Track Action Plan
=====================
Task: Fix the validation error in the login function
Agent Selected: javascript-developer (Success Rate: 0.89, Avg Time: 8min)
Confidence: High based on strong JS performance + exact domain match

Planned Actions:
1. Analyze src/auth/login.js lines 23-45 for validation logic
2. Fix email validation regex pattern (likely issue)
3. Add error handling for edge cases
4. Update corresponding test in tests/auth.test.js

Files Affected:
• src/auth/login.js (edit existing - lines 23-45)
• tests/auth.test.js (modify existing - add 2 test cases)

Expected Outcome: Login validation will properly handle email formats and provide clear error messages
Estimated Time: 8 minutes
Risk Level: Low - Isolated function with existing tests

Proceed with this plan? (y/n/modify)
```

**User Response Options:**
- `y` → Bear executes immediately
- `n` → Bear asks for clarification
- `modify` → Bear offers alternatives or escalates

## Example 2: Feature Addition

**User Request:** `/bear-fast "add dark mode toggle to the settings page"`

**Bear's Response:**
```
Fast Track Action Plan
=====================
Task: Add dark mode toggle to the settings page
Agent Selected: frontend-developer (Success Rate: 0.92, Avg Time: 12min)
Confidence: High based on UI component expertise + CSS framework familiarity

Planned Actions:
1. Add toggle component to src/components/Settings.jsx lines 67-70
2. Create dark mode CSS variables in src/styles/themes.css
3. Add state management for theme preference in src/hooks/useTheme.js
4. Update localStorage handling for persistence
5. Test component in existing Storybook stories

Files Affected:
• src/components/Settings.jsx (edit existing - add toggle section)
• src/styles/themes.css (create new - CSS variables)
• src/hooks/useTheme.js (create new - theme state logic)
• src/components/Settings.stories.js (modify existing - add dark mode story)

Expected Outcome: Users can toggle between light/dark themes, preference persists across sessions
Estimated Time: 12 minutes
Risk Level: Low - Additive feature with no breaking changes

Proceed with this plan? (y/n/modify)
```

## Example 3: Configuration Change

**User Request:** `/bear-fast "update the database timeout to 30 seconds"`

**Bear's Response:**
```
Fast Track Action Plan
=====================
Task: Update the database timeout to 30 seconds
Agent Selected: backend-architect (Success Rate: 0.94, Avg Time: 3min)
Confidence: High based on config management expertise + exact parameter match

Planned Actions:
1. Update database timeout in config/database.js line 12
2. Update corresponding environment variable documentation
3. Verify timeout value in database connection test

Files Affected:
• config/database.js (edit existing - line 12, change timeout value)
• .env.example (edit existing - add/update DB_TIMEOUT documentation)
• tests/database.test.js (edit existing - update timeout test expectation)

Expected Outcome: Database connections will timeout after 30 seconds instead of current 10 seconds
Estimated Time: 3 minutes
Risk Level: Low - Simple configuration change with existing validation

Proceed with this plan? (y/n/modify)
```

## Example 4: User Requests Modification

**User Request:** `/bear-fast "add logging to the payment processing function"`

**Bear's Plan:**
```
Fast Track Action Plan
=====================
Task: Add logging to the payment processing function
Agent Selected: backend-architect (Success Rate: 0.91, Avg Time: 6min)
Confidence: High based on logging implementation experience

Planned Actions:
1. Add debug logging to src/services/payment.js lines 45-120
2. Include transaction ID, amount, and status in logs
3. Add error logging for failed transactions
4. Update log configuration to include payment category

Files Affected:
• src/services/payment.js (edit existing - add logging statements)
• config/logger.js (edit existing - add payment category)

Expected Outcome: Payment processing will have detailed logging for debugging
Estimated Time: 6 minutes
Risk Level: Low - Additive logging with no logic changes

Proceed with this plan? (y/n/modify)
```

**User Response:** `modify`

**Bear's Follow-up:**
```
What would you like to modify about this plan?

Options:
1. Different logging level (info, warn, error instead of debug)
2. Include additional data points (user ID, timestamp, request details)
3. Use different logging library or format
4. Add logging to different payment functions
5. Escalate to Deep Dive for comprehensive payment monitoring

Please specify your preference, or type 'deep' to switch to Deep Dive workflow.
```

## Example 5: Complex Task That Should Escalate

**User Request:** `/bear-fast "implement user authentication with OAuth, JWT, and role-based permissions"`

**Bear's Response:**
```
Fast Track Assessment
====================
Task: Implement user authentication with OAuth, JWT, and role-based permissions
Complexity Analysis: HIGH - Multiple integration points, security considerations, extensive testing needed

This task exceeds Fast Track criteria:
• Estimated time: 2+ hours (exceeds 15min threshold)
• Multiple domains: Authentication, Authorization, Security, Integration
• Requires research: OAuth provider setup, security best practices
• High risk: Security implications, multiple integration points

Recommendation: Escalate to Deep Dive workflow for proper planning and execution.

Options:
1. 'deep' - Switch to Deep Dive workflow (recommended)
2. 'break' - Break into smaller Fast Track tasks
3. 'proceed' - Force Fast Track execution (not recommended for security features)

Your choice?
