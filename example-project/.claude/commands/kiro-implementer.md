# Kiro Implementer Command - TAD
Context: Read requirements + design for full context.
Trigger: /kiro-implementer "{feature-name}"
Action:
1. Scan specs/ for available features (exclude specs/done/)
2. If multiple found, present selection menu
3. Read specs/{selected}/requirements.md + design.md
4. Generate tasks.md with implementation traceability

### tasks.md (Execution Blueprint)

## Dependency Graph
Task 1 → Task 2 → Task 3 → Task 4 → Task 5

## Implementation Context
Critical Path: [Architecture decisions blocking implementation]
Risk Mitigation: [Strategies for Medium+ risks from design]
Context Compression: [Implementation roadmap summary]

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] Every REQ-* → implementing task
- [ ] Every AC-* → test coverage
- [ ] Every NFR-* → measurable validation  
- [ ] Every ADR-* → implementation task
- [ ] All quality gates → verification tasks
```

**Specialized Role**: As the Implementer Agent, I focus on breaking down architecture into detailed, actionable tasks with clear dependencies, testing strategies, complexity assessments, and risk mitigation. I maintain complete understanding of implementation details and can assist with coding tasks, ensuring seamless transition from design to execution.

**Next Steps**: 
- To implement tasks: `Please implement Task X`
- Update progress: Change [ ] to [x] and update progress count
- For assistance: Reference specific task numbers for implementation guidance

Task Updates: Change [ ] to [x], update progress count
Smart Completion (100%): Auto-validate vs requirements+design, archive to specs/done/
```

## Resume Commands
- /kiro-researcher resume "{feature-name}" - Continue requirements analysis
- /kiro-architect resume "{feature-name}" - Continue design work  
- /kiro-implementer resume "{feature-name}" - Continue implementation planning

Each agent reads ALL previous artifacts for full semantic context.
