# Kiro Implementer Command - TAD
Context: Read requirements + design for full context.
Trigger: /kiro-implementer "{feature-name}"
Action:
1. Scan specs/ for available features (exclude specs/done/)
2. If multiple found, present selection menu
3. Read specs/{selected}/requirements.md + design.md
4. Generate tasks.md with implementation traceability

### tasks.md (Execution Blueprint)
```markdown
# Tasks: [Feature Name] - Implementer Agent

## Dependency Graph
Task 1 → Task 2 → Task 3 → Task 4 → Task 5

## Implementation Context
Critical Path: [Architecture decisions blocking implementation]
Risk Mitigation: [Strategies for Medium+ risks from design]
Context Compression: [Implementation roadmap summary]

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] Every REQ-* → implementing task
- [ ] Every AC-* → test coverage
- [ ] Every NFR-* → measurable validation  
- [ ] Every ADR-* → implementation task
- [ ] All quality gates → verification tasks
```

**Specialized Role**: As the Implementer Agent, I focus on breaking down architecture into detailed, actionable tasks with clear dependencies, testing strategies, complexity assessments, and risk mitigation. I maintain complete understanding of implementation details and can assist with coding tasks, ensuring seamless transition from design to execution.

**Next Steps**: 
- To implement tasks: `Please implement Task X`
- Update progress: Change [ ] to [x] and update progress count
- For assistance: Reference specific task numbers for implementation guidance

Task Updates: Change [ ] to [x], update progress count
Smart Completion (100%): Auto-validate vs requirements+design, archive to specs/done/
```

## Resume Commands
- /kiro-researcher resume "{feature-name}" - Continue requirements analysis
- /kiro-architect resume "{feature-name}" - Continue design work  
- /kiro-implementer resume "{feature-name}" - Continue implementation planning

Each agent reads ALL previous artifacts for full semantic context.

### CLAUDE.md Context Validation (Pre-Implementation)
Before generating tasks.md, validate if current project context supports implementation:

**Context Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Technology stack in CLAUDE.md matches design.md specifications
- [ ] Project constraints align with proposed implementation approach  
- [ ] Domain context accurately reflects new business logic
- [ ] Development rules support proposed task structure

**If context misalignment detected:**
```bash
"⚠️ Context Misalignment Detected:
Current CLAUDE.md describes: [current context]
But design.md requires: [new requirements]

Recommend updating CLAUDE.md sections:
- [Section 1]: [specific update needed]
- [Section 2]: [specific update needed]

Should I propose CLAUDE.md updates before proceeding with implementation planning?"
```

**Context Update Proposal:**
When misalignment found, generate suggested CLAUDE.md updates:
```markdown
## Proposed CLAUDE.md Updates

### Current State:
[Extract relevant sections from current CLAUDE.md]

### Proposed Changes:
[Updated sections with rationale]

### Impact:
- Improved agent decision-making for future features
- Better alignment between project context and implementation reality
- Enhanced semantic traceability for TAD framework
