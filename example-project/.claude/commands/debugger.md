# Debugging Workflow in Kiro

## Overview

The Kiro Debugging system provides a structured approach to identifying, analyzing, and resolving issues within your codebase while maintaining the specification-driven development philosophy. This document outlines the debugging process, commands, and best practices.

## Debugging Specifications

When a debugging session is initiated, a debug specification is created in:
```
.kiro/specs/debug-{issue-id}/
```

This follows the same pattern as feature specifications with three key files:

- **requirements.md**: Defines the issue to be resolved in EARS format
- **design.md**: Outlines the debugging strategy and affected components
- **tasks.md**: Lists specific investigation and resolution steps

## Debugging Flow

1. **Issue Detection**: Identify and document the problem
2. **Investigation**: Analyze root causes using context-aware techniques
3. **Solution Design**: Create a strategy to resolve the issue
4. **Implementation**: Apply fixes with appropriate verification
5. **Validation**: Confirm resolution without introducing new issues
6. **Documentation**: Update relevant specifications with insights gained

## Using the Debug Agent

### Initiating a Debug Session

Start a debugging session through natural language in the chat interface:

```
"I'm seeing an error in the login endpoint"
"The application crashes when loading large files"
"Why is the authentication failing?"
```

The system will automatically recognize debugging context and activate debug mode.

### Debug Commands

- **Begin Investigation**: "Investigate why [specific issue] is occurring"
- **Generate Solution**: "Design a fix for [identified issue]"
- **Apply Fix**: "Implement the solution for [issue]"
- **Verify Resolution**: "Verify that [issue] has been resolved"
- **Document Findings**: "Update specifications with debugging insights"

## Debug Specification Structure

### requirements.md

```markdown
# Debug Requirements

## Issue Description
[Concise description of the problem]

## Expected Behavior
[Description of how the system should function when working correctly]

## Acceptance Criteria

WHEN [error condition occurs]
THEN the system SHALL [identify root cause]
AND provide [actionable solution steps]

WHEN [fix is implemented]
THEN the system SHALL [expected resolved behavior]
WITHOUT [introducing new issues]
```

### design.md

```markdown
# Debug Design

## Root Cause Analysis
[Findings from investigation into the source of the issue]

## Affected Components
- [Component 1]: [How it's affected]
- [Component 2]: [How it's affected]

## Related Specifications
- #[[file:.kiro/specs/feature-name/requirements.md]]
- #[[file:.kiro/specs/feature-name/design.md]]

## Solution Strategy
[Detailed approach to resolving the issue]

## Verification Plan
[How to confirm the issue is resolved]

## Risk Assessment
[Potential side effects and mitigation strategies]
```

### tasks.md

```markdown
# Debug Tasks

## Progress: 0/5 completed

- [ ] **Task 1**: Reproduce and isolate the issue
  - Create a reliable reproduction case
  - Identify specific error patterns
  - Dependencies: None

- [ ] **Task 2**: Analyze root cause
  - Trace execution path to failure point
  - Identify contributing factors
  - Dependencies: Task 1

- [ ] **Task 3**: Design solution
  - Create fix strategy
  - Assess potential impacts
  - Dependencies: Task 2

- [ ] **Task 4**: Implement fix
  - Apply necessary code changes
  - Update affected components
  - Dependencies: Task 3

- [ ] **Task 5**: Verify resolution
  - Test fix against reproduction case
  - Run regression tests
  - Update documentation
  - Dependencies: Task 4
```

## Integration with Existing Workflows

The debug agent works alongside other specialized agents:

- **Researcher**: Escalate if issue reveals requirement gaps
- **Architect**: Consult if issue requires design changes
- **Implementer**: Collaborate when fixes involve significant implementation changes

## Best Practices

1. **Always create a reproduction case** before attempting to fix an issue
2. **Document all findings** even if they don't lead directly to a solution
3. **Update original specifications** when debugging reveals gaps
4. **Create regression tests** to prevent issue recurrence
5. **Consider architectural implications** of recurring issues

## Advanced Debugging Capabilities

- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Automatically examines related files and components
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies common error types and solution strategies
- **Multi-Component Debugging**: Traces issues across interacting features
- **Test Generation**: Creates test cases that verify fixes and prevent regression

## Security and Safety

- All proposed fixes undergo risk assessment
- Changes are tracked for rollback capability
- Security implications are evaluated for each solution
- Complex fixes require explicit approval before implementation
