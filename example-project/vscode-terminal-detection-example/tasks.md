## Technical Notes
- **Master Python Tool Preservation**: Build system captures existing claude_auto_responder/ during extension build
- **Zero Logic Duplication**: VSCode extension communicates with bundled Python tool via WebSocket
- **Automatic Lifecycle**: Extension manages Python tool startup/shutdown transparently
- **Cross-Platform Support**: VSCode extension APIs provide cross-platform terminal integration
- **Performance Target**: Sub-200ms end-to-end response time maintained
- **Distribution Method**: Self-build approach for security and transparency
